The body was founded in 1962, thereafter due to its growth, demand and clarity of membership the body was registered with the Registrar of Societies under section 10 of Societies Act on 25th November, 1997.
The association is a member of the Professional Societies of East Africa and is affiliated to the International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW) and collaborates closely with Commonwealth Organization for Social Workers (COSW).
Initially, the membership of the association included the entire Kenya social welfare workforce involved in humanitarian work including those in collective, rehabilitative and curative services. In essence this brought together nurses, probation officers, community development workers, counselors, social activists, paralegals and academia. To date most of these groups have evolved as distinct fully fledged professionalsâ€™ entities with their own professional bodies which, nevertheless, works very closely with social workers practitioners. Among them is probation officers, Medical technicians, nurses social work pedagogues, academia community development workers, and medical social worker.
